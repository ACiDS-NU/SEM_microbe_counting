Counting archea/bacteria in SEM images

# Image info
Images were taken from materials used in *in situ* cultivation experiments at the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO). Situated in the former Homestake gold mine in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, USA, DeMMO is a network of legacy boreholes that intersect fluid-filled fractures spanning depths of 800-4,850 feet. Images with “D1” in the file name are from DeMMO1, a borehole at a depth of 800 feet, “D3” is DeMMO3, a borehole at a depth of 2,000 feet, and “D6” is DeMMO6, a borehole at a depth of 4,850 feet. These experiments targeted the growth of deep subsurface biofilm communities using minerals representative of the host rock lithology (pyrite, hematite, magnetite, pyrolusite, muscovite, siderite, calcite) and inert controls (glass).
