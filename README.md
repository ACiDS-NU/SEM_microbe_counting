# About DeMMO 
The image below shows a cross-sectional view of the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO). Situated in the former Homestake gold mine in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, USA, DeMMO is a network of legacy boreholes that intersect fluid-filled fractures spanning depths of 800-4,850 feet. The grey lines are tunnels and shafts in the mine, and the green dots are the locations of boreholes drilled into the tunnel walls. The boreholes marked by the large dots are called DeMMO1, DeMMO3, and DeMMO6.

# Cultivating deep subsurface biofilm communities at DeMMO
Images were taken from materials used in *in situ* cultivation experiments at the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO).  Images with “D1” in the file name are from DeMMO1, a borehole at a depth of 800 feet, “D3” is DeMMO3, a borehole at a depth of 2,000 feet, and “D6” is DeMMO6, a borehole at a depth of 4,850 feet. These experiments targeted the growth of deep subsurface biofilm communities using minerals representative of the host rock lithology (pyrite, hematite, magnetite, pyrolusite, muscovite, siderite, calcite) and inert controls (glass). Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80g91Z4uEQ&feature=youtu.be) short clip to see how we installed flow-through bioreactors in the outflow of the boreholes at DeMMO. The bioreactors were filled with inert glass or minerals, and over time these materials were colonized by bacteria and archaea. Inside each bioreactor, we included a polished chip of mineral or a glass slide - these were imaged using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
